## 1. Credit Scoring Task

All materials for this task are located in the [`credit_score_task/`](https://github.com/DrUkachi/oxygen-assessment/tree/main/credit_score_task) directory.

- 📓 [Jupyter Notebook: `credit_score_notebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/DrUkachi/oxygen-assessment/blob/main/credit_score_task/credit_score_notebook.ipynb)  
  Contains model training, feature selection, evaluation, and analysis.

- 🧪 [Featurization Code: `featurization_code.py`](https://github.com/DrUkachi/oxygen-assessment/blob/main/credit_score_task/featurization_code.py)

- 🤖 [Inference Script: `inference.py`](https://github.com/DrUkachi/oxygen-assessment/blob/main/credit_score_task/inference.py)  
  Scores new customer data using the trained model.

- 📦 [Trained Model: `trained_model.pkl`](https://github.com/DrUkachi/oxygen-assessment/blob/main/credit_score_task/models/trained_model.pkl)
